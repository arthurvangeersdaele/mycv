Fortunately, I became familiar with the medical staff of the Mzumbe hospital, and they teached me common medical and biotechnical procedures during my stay. I also became friend with other volunteers and ended helping them in a disabled children facility on week-ends.

                        I was an active member of the Makilab, an open-to-all fablab hosting hundreds of projects. My role was to help people to concretize their ideas and designs, and to use the machines (3D printers, heat-press, laser-cutters, etc.).
                        In the mean time, I had the opportunity to use the resources of the Makilab to work on the e-Nable phoenix hand v2. 

                        <br><br>Since I already volunteer in other associations, I decided to not engage officially to the e-Nable community, but I still built a test-hand. It allowed to understand the pros and cons of 3D printed PLA prosthesis, and the main challenges associated: communication, dimensionning and optimization. Later, I presented my work and conclusions during a workshop at Open-hub, and encouraged my audience to take the challenge too.

                    <p class="event-card-description">
                        I was invited by my research partner, 3D-Side, to attend the 2025 Convention of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS). This event provided a valuable opportunity to engage with leading experts and cutting-edge companies in the orthopaedic surgical field.

                        <br><br>The convention spanned five days, during which I presented my research alongside 3D-Side's developments. I also took the opportunity to explore the entire exhibition, discovering new surgical practices, emerging technologies, and innovative materials relevant to my ongoing work.

                        <br><br>In the evenings, I had the chance to engage with 3D-Side's management team, gaining key insights into healthcare company operations, strategic management, and international market development.

                        <br><br>To minimize expenses from my research funding, I opted to stay at the Gaslamp Hostel. This choice allowed me to meet both locals and fellow travelers, providing a rich cultural experience and a deeper understanding of Southern U.S. culture.
